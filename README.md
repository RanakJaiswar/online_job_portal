[Problem Statement](https://github.com/RanakJaiswar/online_job_portal/blob/main/documentation/problem%20starement.pdf)

Presently if the teachers conduct any objective examination, they have to check 
the answer sheets manually which is time consuming and the generation of 
results manually might result in errors or delay in displaying the result. Online 
examination helps students of School / College / Institutions is to offer a quick 
and easy way to appear for the exam. It also provides the results immediately 
after the exam. online examination system saves the exams information in a 
database, teachers can add/delete questions, set the correct answers, specify the 
exam period, register students, delete students, show questions for students 
randomly, calculate and show the final results for students.
So proposed system for an Online Exam Portal is to get or generate their user id 
and password with his/her identity card. This id is already saved in the 
examination server or it will be registered by Admin side. When authenticated 
user login to the server he/she get his/her profile already register so that He does 
not need to waste time in filling profile information. All answers given by user 
are saved into the server with his/her profile information. It also allows user to 
correct the answer if the user needed to change any answer in the examination 
time duration, however after the time duration any change will not allow. As on 
Admin side the admin work is to create new exam questions with proper integrity 
constraints. As admin can also view the Toppers of that exam and can create the 
report card based on the Exam to their Email id registered.
