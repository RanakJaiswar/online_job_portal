[Problem Statement](https://github.com/RanakJaiswar/online_job_portal/blob/main/documentation/PS.pdf)

The employment has been made manual in the past many years upto this current 
situation where everything has totally changed due to technological changes. The 
traditional mode of employment takes a lot of steps from advertisement,
application, verify application and conduct interviews therefore consuming a lot 
of time. The technology is also advancing most job recruitment process has a bit 
changed though some problems still occur. Most companies have developed 
websites where they advertise their jobs and still go back to traditional way where 
application form is downloaded and filled then submitted to the company for 
further verification then be called afterwards for the job. The problems with this 
current system include the following.
1. It is not easy for the job seeker to apply for a specific job he/she needs 
because the job description sometimes does not cover up everything.
2. It is expensive for the job seeker to submit the application form in person 
to the company.
3. In some cases it might not be efficient because not everybody is conversant 
with company websites that exist therefore only few applicants can read 
the post and apply for the job.
4. Paperwork still exists as the application form is downloaded instead of 
being submitted online.
5. There is no chance of uploading Curriculum Vitae (CV) and also the 
members cannot update their profile.
All the above mentioned problems can be solved with the development of the web 
portal where job seekers can create their accounts, upload their Curriculum Vitae 
(CV), apply jobs online, update their profile regularly and wait for a reply.
Moreover, the job seeker has a chance to apply the best job that suits his/her 
specific job skills. The job portal will also help job seekers who donâ€™t know 
various companies and other employers unlike in the current system where 
websites are used where few people are aware of the existing company. The 
portal will be a solution to many who were in need of their dream jobs because 
they will search for it online and be able to apply online too.
